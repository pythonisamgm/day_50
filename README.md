TINDER AUTO-SWIPING BOT
  using selenium library and python 3.9.
  I present two versions/different functions: one to swipe-like and one to swipe-nope.
  
  Some challenges I have found: 
  loggin through facebook page I had to sort some difficulties because the id changes every time to prevent bots.
  to raise exceptions for 1) time delays in tinder page; and 2) going back to profile pictures when a match ocurrs.
  
  due to ethical priciples I have not run the "like version"
